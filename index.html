The Calculay\'s Service'
We agree to provide the User with the Calculay Service. The Service includes all products, features, apps, services, technologies and software that we provide to further our mission, which is: To provide a social alternative channel for reporting racism, violence against women and homophobia.  The Service consists of the following aspects (the Service):
  • CALCULATOR: Do you need to make an account and it is impossible to do it head on? Calculay also acts like a normal calculator, calculating addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponential, square root, percentage, sine, cosine and tangent, as well as other common operations of a scientific calculator.
  • REPORTING CHANNEL: The user will be able to report at any time using our calculator. Just make an account of any expression, and instead of clicking the equal, press the equal button. The anonymous report will go to the map in the Mapping section.
The Data Policy
  • In order to provide our Service, you do not need to provide any personal data, only your location, which is unlikely to compromise very specific locations, since the location involves a 50m radius as an approximation.
Your Commitments
In exchange for our commitment to provide the Service, we require that such commitments below must be made by the user:
  • Who Is Allowed To Use Calculay: Anyone, regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation, sexual orientation and ethnicity, as long as they feel emotionally affected when witnessing a case of violence against women, racism and homophobia.
How Calculay Is Not Allowed To Be Used: In order to be able to provide a secure and open Service to a wide community, it is necessary to establish some limits regarding the use of such application.
  • It is not allowed to abuse the power given by the Calculator to make anonymous reports to make it several times in a single place at intervals of twenty-four hours, under the risk of cancellation of excess requests.
  • It is not allowed to create a false anonymous report, at risk of annulment of requests.
  Social Époque is not responsible for any legal proceedings following the anonymous complaint made by Calculay.
The Permissions You Give Us
  • Permission to upload and install possible updates to the Service on your device.
  • Sharing your location within a 50m radius.
  • Use of complaint data for future research in favor of racial, feminist and LGBTQIA + causes.
Anulation of the Denouement
If the user makes a wrong report, he/she can send an email to socialepoquebr@gmail.com and request the deletion. Social Époque is committed to maintaining the confidentiality of the request, and, consequently, the complaint. It is worth remembering that the user does not need to login. In other words, there is no creation or termination of an account in Calculay.
